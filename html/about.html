            <h2>Who is behind Kitty Corner?</h2>
            <p>My name is Bjedne and I am the creator of Kitty Corner. I am a cat lover and I have a little kitty of my own named Lulu. My family has always owned at least 1 cat at all times, so I grew up living with a cat nearby. I have always loved cats and I have always wanted to have a cat blog. I hope you enjoy my blog and that you learn something new about cats.</p>
